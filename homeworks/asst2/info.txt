Assignment 2: Modeling and Viewing Transformations 
 
Mandatory functionality:
The first task, if you have not done so, display the ray traced output on the screen instead of storing it into the image file.

Then, implement object selection via mouse (and left mouse button click)
Once the object is selected:
- translate it in a view-aligned plane (a plane parallel to the viewing plane) up, down, left, and right.
- rotate it around its own center point in all three world coordinate axes (the center point of the object remains in the same position)
- scale it (center point of the object remains in the same position)
- reset transformations
- hint: the modeling (and also viewing) transformations can be triggered using mouse, keyboard and/or ofxGui

Implement simple camera controls:
- pan the camera horizontally and vertically (panning means moving the camera up, down, left, or right while preserving the direction that the camera is pointing to)
- orbit camera around the scene from equal distance (horizontally and vertically)
- reset camera to the default position
- hint: watch this YouTube link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0xo95O_NMY] to see a visual illustration of various camera movements
 
The mandatory functionality is a guideline for succeeding in obtaining 80% points. You are strongly encouraged to engage yourself with the assignment and implement features from the following optional functionality to get at least 20% points to score the maximum points.
 
Optional functionality:
- implement visual controls for object modeling transformation 10%
- perform camera zooming / dolly operation 10%
- make the scene dynamic where either camera flies a certain path or the scene objects are animated (eg. implement simple physics) 10%
- modify the position of the light source 10%
